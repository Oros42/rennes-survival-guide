# Rennes survival guide

Welcome. Now, what would I do here in your place.
For usual touristic clichés, check [here](https://www.brittanytourism.com/destinations/the-10-destinations/rennes-and-brittanys-historic-gateways/rennes/).

## In short

  - You can check most of the center in around 2 hours by feet I would say (so no need for bus plans)
  - Cabs are a pain to get: not numerous enough, and close to impossible to get as the night grows long
  - Main activity for 20-30yo: bar crawl in [rue de la soif](https://www.tourisme-rennes.com/en/discover-rennes/history-rennes/drinkers-alley-rennes/)
  - Was kind of iconic for rock&roll in the 90s, but that's mostly passed
  - Its a hub to get to Saint Malo, that a must see (40mn by car)

## Where have you landed

Rennes capital of Brittany (along with [Nantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nantes), with French authorities are nicely trying to hide historically).
Brittany still has a strong celtic culture (music, art), but this is not in Rennes that it will be the easiest to get in touch with (except if you're lucky enough to be here for the Yaouank festival). Except during the summer months, city center is packed with students.

## What to bring back from here
  - Not wine. Producing region is far south, except for some Nantes region one, named Muscadet.

## Must see

### Music
  - For clubbing, best is arguably the [1988](https://www.1988liveclub.com/).
  - The rockiest place around: the [Mondo Bizzaro](https://mondobizarro.fr/) (you will have to take a bus).
  - Indie concerts @ le Marquis de Sade, Alex Tavern or le Ty Anna.
  - For the underground techno scene, ask around the [chantier bar](https://fr-fr.facebook.com/barlechantier/) or the elabo.
  - Cool jazzy meetups at the Penny Lane.
  - Breton/traditional sessions frequently at the [Mod Koz](https://fr-fr.facebook.com/sessionmodkoz/).
  - Irish session listed [here](https://thesession.org).

### Bars/Pubs
  - Best for late drinks: the penny lane.
  - Best happy hour with local drafts / best dive bar: la cité d'ys (7pm to 8pm).
  - Fancy cocktails: Le Monfort.
  - Must do a crawl in rue Saint Michel at least once, not to late (<11pm) if you want a bit of space... 

### Food
  - Local classic fast food: a "galette saucisse", that is basically a sausage wrapped in the local pancake variant.
  - Loads of créperies: same pancakes idea, must try, with Breton cider or sauer milk.
  - City is good for fish restaurants. Classic one is Taverne de la marine.

### Local shopping
  - Rennes has an historical market on the saturday morning, which is generally impressive for newcomers (freshest fish!).
  - Good/cheap/complete bakerie, including local specialties: le [fournil Vasselot](https://www.tripadvisor.fr/Restaurant_Review-g187103-d8605434-Reviews-Le_Fournil_Vasselot-Rennes_Ille_et_Vilaine_Brittany.html).
  
### Various
  - Want to chill? Visit the Thabor park. (Quite large considering the city size.)
  - Need a hackerspace to visit? Let's face it, there is no active one today (just sticky echoes of a descent past).
