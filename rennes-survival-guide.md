# Rennes survival guide

Welcome. Now, what would I do here in your place.
For usual touristic clich√©s, check [here](https://www.brittanytourism.com/destinations/the-10-destinations/rennes-and-brittanys-historic-gateways/rennes/).

## In short

  - You can check most of the center in around 2 hours by feet I would say (so no need for bus plans)
  - Cabs are a pain to get: not numerous enough, and close to impossible to get as the night grows long
  - Main activity for 20-30yo: bar crawl in [rue de la soif](https://www.tourisme-rennes.com/en/discover-rennes/history-rennes/drinkers-alley-rennes/)
  - Was kind of iconic for rock&roll in the 90s, but that's mostly passed
  - Its a hub to get to Saint Malo, that a must see (40mn by car)

## Where have you landed

Rennes capital of Brittany (along with [Nantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nantes), with French authorities are nicely trying to hide historically).
Brittany still has a strong celtic culture (music, art), but this is not in Rennes that it will be the easiest to get in touch with (except if you're luck enough to be here fo\
r the Yaouank festival).

## What to bring back from here

## Must go
### Bars/Pubs

### Music
  - The rockiest place around: the [Mondo Bizzaro](https://mondobizarro.fr/) (you will have to take a bus).

### Local shopping
  - Rennes has an historical market on the saturday morning, which is generally impressive for newcomers (freshest fish!).
